    "# Causal Path Significance Ranking Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build up an algorithm to rank causal paths by their \"significance\" using PNS (Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency) scores. PNS (Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency) is a causal importance metric – it “measures both the sufficiency and necessity of X to produce Y” for a given cause-effect pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement a Python algorithm to analyze the causal DAG and rank the most significant causal paths leading to the target incident. The algorithm takes as input the DAG structure, a dictionary of PNS scores for each node, and the specified target variable (incident). \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume we already have a PNS-like score for each variable indicating its importance in causing the incident."

    "The algorithm performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) backwards from the target node through the DAG (following parent links) to enumerate all causal paths ending in the target. For each path found (from some root cause node to the target), it computes a \"path significance\" score by summing the PNS scores of all nodes on that path, with an extra weight applied to the root cause’s score (by default, weight = 2, meaning the root cause’s contribution is doubled). The idea is to prioritize paths where the initial cause is especially critical. The paths are then ranked by this significance score in descending order. \n",
